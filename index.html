            <p>If this were a still life its title could be “Chicken with Two Lemons.” 
                That is all that there is in it. No fat to cook with, no basting to do, 
                no stuffing to prepare, no condiments except for salt and pepper.
                 After you put the chicken in the oven you turn it just once.
                  The bird, with its two lemons, and the oven do all the rest. Again and again, through the years</p>
